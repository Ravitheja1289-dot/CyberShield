# CyberShield - Fraud Email Detection System

CyberShield is a machine learning-powered system designed to detect fraudulent emails. By analyzing the content of email text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and verifying the legitimacy of URLs, CyberShield can identify potentially harmful emails and help users protect themselves from email-based frauds, including phishing and scam attempts.

## Features

* **Email Text Analysis**: Uses NLP to analyze the email body text for suspicious patterns and signs of fraudulent content.
* **URL Legitimacy Verification**: Verifies the authenticity of URLs found within the email to detect phishing attempts or malicious links.
* **Spam Detection**: Identifies common patterns in spam and phishing emails to classify emails as safe or fraudulent.
* **User Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for users to upload email samples for analysis.

## Tech Stack

* **Machine Learning**: Python (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras)
* **Natural Language Processing**: spaCy, NLTK, transformers
* **Web Framework**: Flask/Django (if there's a web interface)
* **Frontend (optional)**: React (if web interface)
* **Database**: SQLite/MySQL for storing data (if applicable)
* **URL Verification**: requests, beautifulsoup4, or dedicated APIs for URL validation

   python app.py
   ```

5. Access the application via your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Usage

### Email Analysis

1. **Input Email**: Upload the email file or paste the email body into the provided input form.
2. **Analysis**: CyberShield will process the email content using machine learning algorithms and NLP to identify any fraudulent signs.
3. **Results**: The system will provide feedback on the likelihood of the email being fraudulent, along with any suspicious URLs.

### URL Legitimacy Check

* If the email contains URLs, CyberShield will attempt to verify the legitimacy of each link by checking against known databases of malicious sites or performing basic heuristics.
